- 🌱 I’m currently learning mainly front end web developement including semantic HTML5, CSS(SCSS), and Javascript. I am also learning precursors frameworks such as React.js along with important web fundamentals!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything as I am looking to strenghten my skills and experience as a web developer and programmer. I am also interested in learning some backend developement as I love growing my skills and expanding my knowledge! However I really enjoy working on the client side and love working on applications revolving around art, animation, entertainment, video games etc!
