- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @spideyInterface
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in becoming a front end develoepr and breaking into the industry as an aspiring junior! I love technology and art and yes I am a big fan of Arcane, Spider-Verse and yes...League of Legends! I really enjoy collaborating with different programmers, engineers, artists etc as I love engaging with different people and their ideas and work!
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning mainly front end web developement including semantic HTML5, CSS(SCSS), and Javascript. I am also learning precursors frameworks such as React.js along with important web fundamentals!
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on just about anything as I am looking to strenghten my skills and experience as a web developer and programmer. I am also interested in learning some backend developement as I love growing my skills and expanding my knowledge! However I really enjoy working on the client side and love working on applications revolving around art, animation, entertainment, video games etc!
- üì´ How to reach me. You can reach me through my email netoguidos@gmail.com or though gitHub or LinkedIn(Ernesto Guidos)! Happy to speak to you guys!

- ‚ö° Fun fact: I never ever thought I would be a programmer. I always loved technology and art however I never really had interest in the space up until two ish years ago! And my first project is an NFT Marketplace and although it is still a work in progress, I am quite proud of how far I have come with it!
